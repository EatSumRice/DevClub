        The banana originated from Southeast Asia
        and the South Pacific. It is said

        and 8000BC. A rumor about the banana
        is that is was the first fruit ever
        cultivated in the world. It is also

        and transported to the New World by
        explorers. (Info from madefruitfair.org).

        The banana has a light yellow color
        on the inside; however, the peel
        is bright yellow and turns brown when
        it is left out in the air for too
        long.

        The banana has a shape of a curved branch of a tree.
        It is often compared to a moon or the microphone.
        Compared to the moon and curved branches, however,
        the banana is more tasty... and edible.
